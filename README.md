# Maryland High School Boys Basketball Performance Project

## Overview
This project explores historical high school basketball data across Maryland, with a focus on identifying patterns of competitive success by jurisdiction. The goal was to clean and organize raw historical data in preparation for analysis and visualization.

## Data Source
The original dataset was compiled from manually researched records, including Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association (MPSSAA) archives and other open-source records. It includes school names, districts, and tournament results from 1947 to 2025.

## What I Did
- Standardized school names and jurisdictions
- Created new columns to reflect total championships, finals appearances, and semifinal appearances
- Identified and corrected jurisdiction errors (e.g., schools listed in incorrect counties)
- Organized the data for future use in visualizations and scoring models
- Created visualizations to illustrate trends in Maryland high school boys basketball state tournament.

## Next Steps
- Develop a scoring index for schools based on tournament performance
- Possibly integrate the data with maps or school demographic info

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (for data cleaning and organization)
- PowerBI (for data visualization)
- GitHub (for documentation and storage)
